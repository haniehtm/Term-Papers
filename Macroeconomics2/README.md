International Dimensions of Climate Change Policies
Climate change is one of the most critical challenges of the 21st century, which poses significant risks to the global economy, environmental sustainability, and human well-being. The urgency to address climate change has intensified, with South Korea emerging as a focal point in global climate politics due to its rapid industrialization, significant greenhouse gas emissions, and strategic location. Understanding the international dimensions of climate change policies is essential to understanding how different countries contribute to and can mitigate this global issue.
