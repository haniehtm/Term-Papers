21-centimeter radiation:

21 cm radiation refers to a specific wavelength of radio waves emitted by neutral hydrogen atoms which constitute 75% of the gaseous mass of the cosmos. It is named after the 21-centimeter (or 21 cm) wavelength corresponding to the transition between the atom’s two lowest energy states. This transition occurs when the electron’s spin flips from being parallel to the proton’s spin to being anti-parallel.
