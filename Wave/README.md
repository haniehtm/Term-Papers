Exploring Periodic Boundary Conditions: A Study on 2D and 3D Spheres and Continuum Limit:

We analyze systems with periodic boundary conditions in two and three dimensions. Beginning with an N-particle system confined to a circle, we derive the governing ordinary differential equation and solve it both analytically using circulant matrices and numerically. We then take the continuum limit as N goes to infinity to obtain a wave equation on the circle with periodic boundary conditions. This partial differential equation is solved exactly, allowing us to construct visualizations of the propagating waves. Next we study an N-particle system confined to the surface of a regular polyhedron, deriving the discrete equations and solving numerically using symmetry arguments. We then discuss statistical mechanics approaches for this system. Finally, we analyze longitudinal elastic waves propagating on a sphere, deriving the continuum wave equation in spherical coordinates and discussing analytical and numerical solution methods based on spectral decomposition. Throughout we emphasize the mathematical physics, solving equations analytically where possible and numerically otherwise. Results for all systems are illustrated through figures.
