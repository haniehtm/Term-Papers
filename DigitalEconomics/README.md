Converting Data into Goods in Banking (Saman Bank in Iran):
In the 20th century, oil was considered the most valuable commodity. In the 21st century, its equivalent is data. Data has always been an important commodity for many businesses. Still as the digital revolution continues to transform the banking sector, the value of data has risen to a new level of importance. In a world where we are witnessing a move from human-driven cars to self-driving cars, a similar transformation is taking place in banking. We are transforming from banking to autonomous or cognitive banking, where artificial intelligence and machine learning are changing the customer experience of financial services.
Every day, banking customers generate an astronomical amount of data through hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of individual transactions. We generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day! As a result, banks and financial services organizations always keep a large and huge amount of data in their institutions, this amount of data, along with the unlimited processing power through the cloud to manipulate, integrate and match different sources, makes data one of the become the most important resources of these organizations. But historically, they haven’t been good at interpreting and monetizing the value of this data.
