SONGBIRD-SOCIAL DATA ANALYSIS:
Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called arcs or lines). There are many types of graphs, including undirected graphs, directed graphs (also known as digraphs), weighted graphs, bipartite graphs, and others. Each type of graph has its own unique properties and uses.
Network analysis is a method of analyzing complex systems by representing them as graphs. In this context, a "network" is simply another term for a graph. The nodes in the network represent entities (which could be anything from people in a social network, to computers in a computer network, to neurons in a neural network), and the edges represent relationships or interactions between these entities.
By representing a complex system as a network, we can use the tools and techniques of graph theory to analyze the system. For example, we can use graph theory to identify the most important nodes in the network (a process known as centrality analysis), to detect communities of nodes that are more densely connected with each other than with the rest of the network (community detection), to measure the networkâ€™s robustness to failures or attacks, and so on.
In summary, graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for network analysis, allowing us to analyze complex systems in a rigorous and systematic way.
In this article, we are looking to investigate one of the most interesting networks, which is bird song, and draw its graph, explain and calculate some of its parameters such as density, transitivity, degree assortativity coefficient, and ext.
