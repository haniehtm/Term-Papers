# Term Papers of Optics:
Optics, a branch of physics, deals with the behavior and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction of instruments that use or detect it. One of the fascinating phenomena in optics is diffraction, which refers to various phenomena that occur when a wave collides with an obstacle or gap.
In this project, we will focus on a special type of diffraction called Fraunhofer diffraction. Named after the German physicist Joseph von Fraunhofer, this type of diffraction occurs when the incoming light is essentially parallel and the diffracted waves are observed at a great distance, so they are also effectively parallel.
The main goal of our project is to simulate Fraunhofer diffraction for different objects and slits. By doing this, we aim to understand how the shape of the object and the size of the gap affect the diffraction pattern. This understanding is critical in many applications, such as the design of optical instruments and the interpretation of observations in astronomy.
